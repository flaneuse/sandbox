        <div class="paragraph">Rwanda’s extraordinary recovery from complete political, economic and social collapse after the
1994 genocide represents one of Africa’s most dramatic and encouraging success stories. Annual economic growth rates are among
Africa’s highest, and huge strides have been made in social indicators such as child and infant
mortality, household income, and primary-school enrollment levels. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Nevertheless, Rwanda remains among the world’s poorest and most densely populated countries.</div>
<div class="paragraph">We wanted to understand two fundamental questions about poverty in Rwanda:
  <ul class="summary-list">
<li>The total fertility rate &ndash; how many children a woman will have in her lifetime &ndash; has decreased from a peak of
  <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-43.cfm" target="_blank">6.2</a> to <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-468.cfm" target="_blank"><mark>4.2 children/woman</mark></a> on average.
  However, the fertility rate is leveling off rather than continuing to decrease, which will introduce strain on systems.
<strong>What's responsible for the slow down in fertility reductions?</strong></li>
  <li>Though Rwanda has had dramatic economic growth in the past 25 years,
  chronic child malnutrition remains high across the country,
  affecting
  <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-468.cfm" target="_blank"><mark>nearly 40% of children under 5</mark></a>. <strong>
    Why aren't economic improvements being translated as quickly to decreases in stunting?</strong></li>
