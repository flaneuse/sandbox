          <div class="title">Stunting in Rwanda</div>
          <div class="paragraph"> We just looked at <a href="">Rwanda's increasing population</a>. One downstream effect of an increasing population is pressure on household-level resources, including nutrition.</div>
          <div class="paragraph">Stunting is one measure of chronic malnutrition in children. When a child is chronically malnourished, he or she often has long-term,
            lifetime effects, including poor physical growth, impaired cognitive development, and poor economic development. Additionally, <a href="">one study</a>
            estimates that stunting is responsible for almost 40% of all childhood deaths worldwide.</div>

          <section class="step">
            <div class="title">How much of an issue is stunting in Rwanda?</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Let's start by looking at stunting in 2010.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Nationally, <mark>44%</mark> of children under 5 are stunted, meaning they have have abnormally low height for their age
              <a href="">(learn more about how stunting is calculated)</a>.</div>
              <div class="paragraph">If we just look at the national average, though, or even a distribution of the national scores,
                we miss any variation across geography.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Are children across the country equally likely to be stunted?</div>
              </section>

              <!-- #3 2010 by LZ map -->
              <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Stunting varies across the country</div>
                <div class="paragraph">We can group the children into <a href="http://www.fews.net/east-africa/rwanda/livelihood-description/september-2015" target="_blank">FEWS NET livelihood zones</a>, which are geographic regions grouped by where households have similar ways of making a living.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">We begin to see that stunting is quite different across the country.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">In the Northen Highland Beans and Wheat zone, stunting is 57% &ndash; 13% over the national average. Kigali City, on the other hand, has the lowest stunting prevalence at 22%.</div>

              <section class="step">
                <div class="title">High stunting in the east and northwest, low in urban areas</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Looking at the values on a map, the urban areas pop out as being low compared to the rest of the country.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Do these patterns still hold today?</div>
              </section>


              <!-- #5 2010-2014 dotplot changes -->
              <section class="step">
                <div class="title">How have the areas changed over time?</div>
                <div class="paragraph">In Rwanda stunting has decreased remarkably in the past five years&mdash; dropping from <mark>44%</mark> of children under 5 in 2010 to <mark>37%</mark> in 2014/2015 nationally. </div>
              </section>

              <!-- #6 2010-2014 dotplot changes -->
              <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Improvements haven't been equal everywhere</div>
                <div class="title">Alt: Though the East has improved markedly, gains lag in the Northwest</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Though the regions in the Northwest improved, they didn't change as fast as the East.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Indeed, the stunting incidence in the northwest 2014/2015 is essentially where it was in 2010 in the East.</div>
              </section>

              <!-- #9 2014 dotplot -->
              <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Which areas still lag in 2014/2015?</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Focusing just on the most recent stunting data, children in the West Congo-Nile Crest Tea region now have the highest incidence of stunting in Rwanda.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Why do these patterns exist? Are they the result of some intrinsic difference in the people who live there; for instance,
                  are the people in the West Congo-Nile Crest Tea region less wealthy, less educated, or have poorer diets?</div>
                  <div class="paragraph">Or is there something more closely tied to that region that explains this phenomenon?</div>
                </section>

                <section class="step">
                  <div class="title">Geography matters</div>
                  <div class="paragraph">Using the household-level data from the <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-468.cfm" target = "_blank">Demographic and Health Surveys</a>
                    and the <a href="https://www.wfp.org/content/rwanda-comprehensive-food-security-and-vulnerability-analysis-march-2016" target="_blank">Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis</a>, we ran regressions &mdash; statistical tests for whether there's a relationship between stunting and various related factors.</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">The power of regressions is their ability to test whether there's an effect of a particular factor (like geography) on whether a child is stunted.</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">So, accounting for other factors that we think might influence malnutrition &ndash; like age and sex of the child or the education and wealth of the household &ndash;
                      we can examine whether any of the livelihood zones are different than the rest of the country.
                    </div>
                  </section>

                  <!-- #11 2014 geo regressions -->
                  <section class="step">
                    <div class="title">Stunting improvements lag in the northwest 2014</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">Stunting is significantly higher in the Northwestern Volcanic Irish Potato and Eastern Congo-Nile Highland Subsistence Farming zones compared to the Lake Kivu Coffee belt.</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">Interestingly, the changes we observed in the geographic distribution of stunting are also bourne out in the regressions: the east
                      (Eastern Plateau Mixed Agricultural and Eastern Agropastoral zones) were worse than the coffee belt in 2010, but in 2015 they were actually slightly better, all other things equal.</div>
                      <div class="paragraph">Lastly, in both years, the altitude of the household dwelling influenced whether a child was stunted, suggesting that accessibility may be partially driving high stunting in the northwest.</div>
